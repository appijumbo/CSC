whyispeak: 'I joined Chester Speaking Club because it was on-the-spot speaking I wanted to improve. These last two years, my ‘improvised’ speaking has been transformed. I think faster, I speak clearer, my insights are vivid and entertaining and it has taken me from the board room to national debates on the stage at the British Medical Association. Excellent communication will transform your personal and professional lives and as Club President, I want everyone to have access to this incredible opportunity'
